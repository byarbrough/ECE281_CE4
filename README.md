##PRISM Assembly Language Programming

###So what exactly is "Assembly" anyways?
Well, think of Lego blocks: you only have so many different blocks (in this case 16) to work with, but can build an almost unlimited amount of things. Also, because Santa is on a budget, you have to try and fit everything within 256 addresses because after all, RAM and ROM - er, Legos - ain't cheap. _PRISM_ (That's Programmable Reconfigurable Informational 
Simple Microcomputer) is a simulation of a typical digital computer which allows for easy programming of in an Assembly syle. Feel free to thumb through the Manual - provided by USAFA DFEC - for more information on how everything works, but basically there is a computer Controller which directs the Datapath, Memory, and Input/Output.

##So What?
Why go through all of this trouble in the first place? I mean there are tons of high level languages out there which could do this with a lot less thinking.
